## Routing

The [Yii Router](https://github.com/yiisoft/router) is the main entry point for the application. It is responsible for matching the incoming request to a route and dispatching the request to the appropriate controller.

The following example shows how to create configuration for the [Yii Router](https://github.com/yiisoft/router):

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use Yiisoft\Config\Config;
use Yiisoft\DataResponse\Middleware\FormatDataResponse;
use Yiisoft\Csrf\CsrfMiddleware;
use Yiisoft\Router\Group;
use Yiisoft\Router\RouteCollection;
use Yiisoft\Router\RouteCollectionInterface;
use Yiisoft\Router\RouteCollectorInterface;

/** @var Config $config */

return [
    RouteCollectionInterface::class => static function (RouteCollectorInterface $collector) use ($config) {
        $collector
            ->middleware(CsrfMiddleware::class)
            ->middleware(FormatDataResponse::class)
            ->addGroup(Group::create('/{_language}')
            ->routes(...$config->get('routes')));

        return new RouteCollection($collector);
    },
];
```

The `$config->get('routes')` statement is used to get the routes from the `routes` configuration file. The `routes` configuration file is located in the `config` directory and contains the following code:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use App\Controller\SiteController;
use Yiisoft\Router\Route;

return [
    Route::get('/')->action([SiteController::class, 'index'])->name('home'),
];
```

The `Route::get('/')` statement creates a route that matches the `GET` request to the `/` path. The `action()` method specifies the action that should be executed when the route is matched. The `name()` method specifies the name of the route. The name of the route is used to generate URLs.

The `routes` configuration file can contain multiple routes. The routes can be grouped into groups. The following example shows how to create a group of routes:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use App\Controller\SiteController;

return [
    Group::create('/site')
        ->routes(
            Route::get('/contact')->action([SiteController::class, 'contact'])->name('site/contact'),
            Route::get('/about')->action([SiteController::class, 'about'])->name('site/about'),
        ),
];
```

The `Group::create('/site')` statement creates a group of routes that matches the `/site` path. The `routes()` method specifies the routes that should be added to the group.
